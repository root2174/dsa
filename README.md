# DSA

This is a simple Data Structures and Algorithms repository solely for studies purposes.
It's written in python, using Jupyter Notebook for quick summaries and code examples.

This repository exists to make me a better developer, to understand the core concepts and fundamentals of DSA. 
Not only for leetcoding to get into a half decent company. /s
